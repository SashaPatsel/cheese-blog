            <p>Hello Curd-nerds!</p>
            <p>
                I’m so glad you found this cheese blog! Now, we all know that half the fun of cheese is taking pictures
                with it, and this got me thinking – how well does the internet represent our true cheese-loving selves?
            </p>
            <p>
                 Without further ado, please enjoy this list of my top 10 favorite stock photos of people eating cheese:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>10. This woman, who clearly thinks her cheese is…suspicious, to say the least:</p>
                    <img src="images/stock1.png" alt="">
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        9. Yeah girl yeah! Just dive into it! I’m proud of you. 
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/stock2.png" alt="">
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        8. This woman, who is judging us all, but with cheese:  
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/stock3.png" alt="">
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        7. Have you ever been trapped at a table with a hipster who WON’T stop talking about how much they know about cheese, and how you can really just taste the fresh grass the cows ate, and that they wouldn’t be caught DEAD getting cheese from a non-specialty store, and that brie cheese is just the poor man’s camembert? This is that person: 
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/stock4.png" alt="">
                    <p>Unrelated: Who just puts a full pepper as a centerpiece? Someone chop that pepper! And is it in a bowl of broccoli?? This party is MADNESS. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        6. This baby knows what’s up. I trust this baby. 
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/stock5.png" alt="">
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        5. Lady, that’s not….that’s not how you do it. 
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/stock6.png" alt="">
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        4. You know the common adage, “Stop and smell the cheese?” Anyway, Karen’s about to get kicked out of this grocery store. 
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/stock7.png" alt="">
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        3. I mean, whatever. 
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/stock8.png" alt="">
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        2. THIS MAN IS AMAZING AND HE CLEARLY KNOWS SOMETHING WE DON’T. TAKE HIS CHEESE SAMPLE AND ACCEPT HIS KNOWLEDGE ON THE SECRETS OF LIFE. 
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/stock9.jpg" alt="">
                    <img src="images/stock10.png" alt="">
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        1. It was a tough call on the last and best stock photo, but upon careful reflection, I landed on….CHEESE SCIENCE: 
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/stock11.png" alt="">
                    <p>
                            Dissect it. Carefully. On a scale (?). In a petri dish. For science. 
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                    This concludes my list of favorite cheese stock photos. Thank you for coming to my TED talk.
